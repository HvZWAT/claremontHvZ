Claremont Humans vs. Zombies Site
====================================

# Humans vs. Zombies Mailer

This is a mailer application for moderators of the 5C-wide game, Humans vs. Zombies. It allows moderators to quickly email subsets of players registered in the HvZ website. The mailer is only accessible to those with Django admin privileges (which HvZ moderators should have). 

## Prerequisites
Python 3,
Django 2.0,
Git

## Gems
Virtualenv,
Compass

## Installation
These are the installation instructions from the original creators of the HvZ website. 

Dev machine setup
-----------------

Developing for the site will require [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/), [VirtualEnv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/),
and [Compass](http://rubygems.org/gems/compass). If you are familiar with and have (or know how to
get) all of these, feel free to skip this section.

First off, install [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/) using your favorite package manager. If you're developing on a Mac, I recommend installing/using [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) as your package manager of choice. Then `brew install python` will install pip.

Using pip, you should have an easy time installing virtualenv:

    pip install virtualenv

Secondly, you'll need to install [Compass](http://rubygems.org/gems/compass). You can do this with

    sudo gem install compass

If you don't have RubyGems installed, get Compass installed using your
favorite package manager or method.

Building the site
-----------------

Now create a root directory for your site. Mine is
`~/programming/claremonthvz.org`.

Note that I'm going to refer to `~/programming` everywhere. If your
root directory is in a different place, use your imagination and
substitute accordingly.

Now build a virtualenv in the root directory, which for me was

    virtualenv ~/programming/claremonthvz.org

Virtualenv provides a wrapper between your machine and the site. As
long as the site only interacts with packages inside this wrapper, we
know that we can port the site over to other machines without
accidentally relying on some random laptop's quirks.

To actually *use* the virtualenv, you'll need to activate it:

    source ~/programming/claremonthvz.org/bin/activate

This command only affects your current terminal, so you'll need to
rerun it every time you want to work on the site. I highly recommend
you add an alias to your .bashrc along the lines of

    alias hvz="cd ~/programming/claremonthvz.org && source bin/activate && cd claremontHvZ/HVZ"

Clone your forked GitHub repo (you don't have to use the command line
for this):

    git clone git@github.com:MYUSERNAME/claremontHvZ.git

Now complete the build with

    python ~/programming/claremonthvz.org/claremontHvZ/setup.py

The Django 2.0 version is located at the update brach.
If all went well, that should be it! 

### Running a development version of the server

To run a development version of the server:

    python manage.py runserver

You can then access the site by directing your browser to `localhost:8000`.

### Running unit tests

To run our unit tests:

    python manage.py test HVZ

These tests will check registration, feeding, and permission scenarios.

## Functionality
W.A.T.:
Mailer form interface
Filter by player type
Multiple school selection filter
Single file attachments
BCC recipient list
Mailer button in navigation bar
Rotating sender address

Red Bunnies:
Filter by each college
Failure page
Print out player list

## Known Problems
To check if you have created your virtual environment correctly for python, use `which python3’ to check your python path
If python’s path is the actual directory of your virtual environment, then it is at the right place
If not, then we suggest you to recreate a virtual environment again

Use “pip install” to resolve missing modules (django, markdown, etc…)
If you ever get a “no module named ‘root’” error or “returned non-zero exit status 1” developers don’t know how to resolve that yet. Best of luck to you.
